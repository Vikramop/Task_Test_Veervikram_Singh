## About BLUME TOKEN (BLX)

BLUME is a cryptocurrency company focused on decentralized finance (DeFi) solutions. Our project, **BLUME TOKEN (BLX)**, is designed to power a comprehensive ecosystem that includes:

- **Liquidity Pools** – Enabling users to provide liquidity and earn transaction fees.
- **Vaults** – Secure smart contract-based storage for BLX tokens.
- **Staking** – Users stake BLX tokens to earn rewards.
- **Liquid Staking** – Users receive derivative tokens for their staked BLX, allowing further participation in DeFi activities 

## Security & Audit Readiness

This project follows best practices to ensure smart contract security and audit readiness. Below are the key aspects and instructions for running security checks.

### Security Best Practices Implemented

- **Reentrancy Protection:**  
  Uses OpenZeppelin’s `ReentrancyGuard` and the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern to prevent reentrancy attacks.

- **Flash Loan Safeguards:**  
  Loan functions enforce valid collateral checks to prevent flash loan exploits.

- **Integer Overflow/Underflow Prevention:**  
  Solidity 0.8+ built-in overflow checks are used, eliminating the need for external SafeMath libraries.

- **Oracle Security:**  
  Trusted decentralized oracles (e.g., Chainlink) are recommended for price feeds to avoid oracle manipulation.

- **Access Control:**  
  Role-based access control (RBAC) is implemented via OpenZeppelin’s `Ownable` and `AccessControl` contracts.

- **Gas Optimization:**  
  Storage variables and computations are minimized; events are used for logging state changes.

### Running Security Analysis

#### Slither Static Analysis

Slither is used to perform static security analysis on the Solidity contracts.

**Install Slither:**

```pip install slither-analyzer```

**Run Slither on the project:**

```slither .```

This command analyzes all contracts and reports potential vulnerabilities.

**Run specific detectors (e.g., reentrancy):**

```slither . --detect reentrancy-eth,reentrancy-no-eth,reentrancy-benign,reentrancy-events```

---

### Testing

- Unit tests cover all core functionalities and simulate attack vectors such as unauthorized minting, exceeding max transaction amounts, and cooldown enforcement.
- Additional tests simulate reentrancy and access control attacks.
- Continuous integration runs all tests and Slither scans on every commit to ensure ongoing security.
